These distributions are known to be working with muninlite:

* Floppyfw 3.0
 - Needs a busybox with inetd
 - See http://pong.no/floppyfw/muninlite/
 
* Endian Firewall Community 2.1
 - Needs some kind of inetd (xinetd RPM from Centos might work)
 - # rpm -ivh --nodeps ftp://mirror.ii.uib.no/sites/msync.centos.org/centos/2.1/final/i386/CentOS/RPMS/xinetd-2.3.11-2.AS2.1.i386.rpm
 - Remove '[ "${NETWORKING}" = "yes" ] || exit 0' from /etc/inet.d/xinetd
 - Add /etc/xinetd.d/munin (see examples dir for config)
 - Add munin (port 4949) to /etc/services 
 - Add "munin-node : <ip adress of munin gatherer>" to /etc/hosts.allow
 
* OpenSuSE 10.2 
 - Just works
