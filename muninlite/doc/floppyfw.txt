How to make busybox with inetd
------------------------------
Some version numbers might be different, but the steps should be valid
anyway.

Get a copy of the floppyfw devkit:
# http://www.zelow.no/floppyfw/trac/wiki/TheDevkit

Follow the readme to get a svn check out of the source.
For the stable 3.0 series, the command is as follows:
# svn co http://www.zelow.no/svn/floppyfw-3.0 

Edit the BusyBox config with your favourite editor. It's located at
/floppyfw-3.0/configs/config-busybox-1.2.2.1

Change the line "# CONFIG_INETD is not set" to "CONFIG_INETD=y".

To add the muninlite package, you should download muninlite.mk.txt from
http://pong.no/floppyfw/muninlite/.

Rename muninlite.mk.txt to muninlite.mk and place in the makefile
directory.

Edit /floppyfw-3.0/Makefile. Find all the TARGETS and add
"TARGETS+=muninlite" next to them.

Then build your own version of floppyfw:
# cd /floppyfw-3.0; make

If you want additional packages, copy the .ffw-files from the
/floppyfw-3.0/build_i386/ directory to the /floppyfw-3.0/floppy/packages
directory.

Download post-muninlite.ini.txt from http://pong.no/floppyfw/muninlite/
to the /floppyfw-3.0/floppy/packages directory and rename it to 
post-muninlite.ini.

Make the floppy-image:
# cd /floppyfw-3.0; make floppyimage

You now have a floppy image with muninlite installed and configured.
Transfer the image to a floppy and make your customizations to the
config and floppyfw.ini files (if any are needed).

Boot your firewall.

If it works, you will see these messages during boot:

  Looking for post- scripts...
  /mnt/tmp/packages/post-muninlite.ini stripped
  /mnt/tmp/packages/post-muninlite.ini chmoded
  Running /etc/post-muninlite.ini
  Starting inetd.
